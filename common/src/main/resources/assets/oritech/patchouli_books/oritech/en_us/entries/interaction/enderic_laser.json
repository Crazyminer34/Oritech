Then shift+right-click the **bottom** laser block to assign the target. The laser will keep firing in the target direction as long as there is something to target. *Note that you're only setting the target direction. This means that the laser will also destroy blocks before and behind the target*. A redstone signal disables the laser. The maximum range is 64."

The default is attacking monsters only, but you can also have it attack animals or even wandering traders. Be careful where you use it and how you set the targeting, because you could end up killing things you don't want to kill."

The laser itself only has 1 addon slot available at the bottom. Addons will only affect the speed and efficiency of block breaking, energy transfer can only benefit from speed upgrades. A target block will stop the laser from going any further, while not being destroyed."

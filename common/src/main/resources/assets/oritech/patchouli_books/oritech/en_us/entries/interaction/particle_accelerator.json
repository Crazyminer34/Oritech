When it is powered on, it will lead particles straight, and when powered off it will guide it into the original curved direction. However, a particle can also enter from the 'other' direction. This is visualized with the smaller red glass tube. It will follow the path of the white tube, and can enter from both the red and white tube."

If the last full 90-degree turn is too close behind, it will exit the guided path and instead shoot out into the world. If the distance between guide blocks is too big, or no next guide is found, it will also shoot out into the world. The minimum distance between turns is calculated this way:\n> sqrt(speed) / 3"

You can build a straight line of motors to just shoot the particles at something. However, if you want to reach higher speeds, a circular design is usually much more efficient. When trying to reach certain elements, very large rings might be needed. As slow particles require guide rings to be close together, it often makes sense to first start the particle in a small ring, and then use redstone to take it into a bigger ring."

Since the amount of energy required to achieve this is immense, very little is known about these incursions and what triggers them. Researchers have noted that colliding fire charges with a collision energy over 5000J seems to bring the nether closer. Ender pearls and more than 10000J appear to be doing the same for the end dimension."
